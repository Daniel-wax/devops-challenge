# MyDataModels DevOps Challenge

You have been asked to create the infrastructure for running a web application on a cloud platform of your preference (AWS preferred, Google Cloud Platform, Azure, or personnal cloud are also fine).

The goal of the challenge is to demonstrate hosting, managing, and documenting a production-ready system.

This is not about website content or UI.

## Requirements

- Deliver the tooling to set up the application on the cloud platform of your choice (free tiers are fine).

## Extra Mile Bonus (not a requirement)

- Describe a possible solution for CI and/or CI/CD in order to release a new version of the application to production without any downtime.
